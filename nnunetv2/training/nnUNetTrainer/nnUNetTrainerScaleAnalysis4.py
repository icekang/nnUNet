        The default split is a 5 fold CV on all available training cases. nnU-Net will create a split (it is seeded,
        so always the same) and save it as splits_final.json file in the preprocessed data directory.
        Sometimes you may want to create your own split for various reasons. For this you will need to create your own
        splits_final.json file. If this file is present, nnU-Net is going to use it and whatever splits are defined in
        it. You can create as many splits in this file as you want. Note that if you define only 4 splits (fold 0-3)
        and then set fold=4 when training (that would be the fifth split), nnU-Net will print a warning and proceed to
        use a random 80:20 data split.
